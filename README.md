# iVestor
An award-winning mock co-investment web application at Singapore's inaugural PolyFintech100 API Hackathon. Went on to present at world's largest fintech festival, Singapore Fintech Festival.

Further improvised iVestor for a school assignment by integrating it with Fidor's sandbox account and various new APIs to complete the application.

APIs include:
1. AlphaVantage: real-time market data
2. NewsAPI: real-time financial news
